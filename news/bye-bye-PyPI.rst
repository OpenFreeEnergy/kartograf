**Deprecated:**

* We no longer distribute the package on PyPI.
  Since all of the dependences of the package do not exist on PyPI, users would have to install the dependences manually.
  We have decided that all new kartograf releases will be solely distributed via conda-forge.
  We have uploaded a placeholder version of the package that when imported, directs users to install the package from conda-forge instead of PyPI.
