    """
    Remove cases where a bond would be broken during the transformation.
    These are detected by checking that all bonds of ligand A which are in the mapping also form a bond in ligand B,
    if they do not the atoms are removed from the mapping.

    See <https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/kartograf/issues/88> for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mol_a
        Molecule at state A with atom indices in the keys of the mapping dict
    mol_b
        Molecule at state B with atom indices in the values of the mapping dict
    mapping
        The mapping between molecule A and B

    Returns
    -------
        A filtered mapping removing any entries which map a broken bond.
