Welcome to kartograf's documentation!
=========================================
Kartograf is a packgage for atom mappings focussing on 3D geometries.
This package can be for example be used to generate hybrid topology systems, where an atom mapping is required to determine the core region of the approach.
But of course there exist also other use cases for this package.
The atom mapper takes two set of coordinates of molecules as input.
Optionally those set of coordinates can be aligned onto each other, checkout
the ``atom_aligner`` module functions
of Kartograf that offer a shape alignment implementation and a MCS-skeleton alignment.
The ``atom_mapper`` can be used to generate the 3D geometry focused atom
mapping, the algorithm is described in the related publication of Kartograf (see reference).
Additionally, rule based filter functions can be provided to demap atoms,
that do not fullfill the desired criteria, see ``filters``.
Several mapping scoring metrics are provided, that evaluate geometric
properties of your mapping, from ``atom_mapping_scorer``, which might be
useful for checking quality of your mappings.
Finally, there is a visualization function ``display_mappings_3d`` that can be
used to check out the mappings with a jupyter notebook widget.
